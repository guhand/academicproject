**Blockchain-Based Electronic Health Records Management**

**Description**:-
Data security or secure storage of medical information is usually a significant concern for the bulk of the population. An efficient healthcare system needs a technology platform to speak firmly and seamlessly. Blockchain has been emerging technology for a few years now. The key options of blockchain which attract most developers are its immutableness, decentralization, transparency, distributed ledger. We tend to propose a Healthcare Secure Data Storage System (Life Care) that firmly manages personal medical records and creates an interaction between Doctors and Patients. The LifeCare system is meant to improve the current systems because it provides interoperable, secure, and effective access for medical records by patients. It provides timed-based smart contract for governing transactions and dominant access to electronic medical records. The security is ensured by using SHA-256 encryption technique with Blockchain to store hash data for providing security, new incentive mechanism that leverages the degree of health suppliers concerning their efforts in maintaining medical records and making new blocks.
